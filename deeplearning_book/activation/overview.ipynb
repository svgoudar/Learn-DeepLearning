    "## Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "An **activation function** is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron. Its role is to determine whether a neuron should “activate” (i.e., pass its value forward) or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without activation functions, neural networks would just be **linear models**, no matter how many layers they have — meaning they couldn’t learn complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do We Need Activation Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 1. Introduce Non-Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world data and problems (like vision, speech, and language) are **non-linear**. Activation functions allow neural networks to **model complex relationships**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. Help with Hierarchical Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions allow deeper layers to progressively learn higher-level features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Early layers → edges, curves\n",
    "* Middle layers → shapes, patterns\n",
    "* Final layers → objects, decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3. Control the Flow of Information\n",
    "\n",
    "They decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much signal should pass forward (forward propagation)\n",
    "* How much gradient should pass backward (backpropagation)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Linear Activation**\n",
    "\n",
    "➤ *Used rarely* (except in some output layers).\n",
    "`f(x) = x` → No non-linearity, so limited learning capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Sigmoid (Logistic)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "[\n",
    "\\sigma(z)= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Output range: (0, 1)\n",
    "✔ Good for **binary classification** (output layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Main problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vanishing gradient**\n",
    "* Saturates for large +ve / -ve values\n",
    "* Not zero-centered\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "[\n",
    "\\tanh(z) = \\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Output range: (−1, 1)\n",
    "✔ Zero-centered\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Still suffers from **vanishing gradients**\n",

    "---\n",

    "### 4. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "[\n",
    "f(x) = \\max(0, x)\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Fast and simple\n",
    "✔ Works well for **hidden layers**\n",
    "✔ Doesn’t saturate for positive values\n",
    "✔ Helps avoid vanishing gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Can cause **“dead neuron” problem** (output always 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "Fixes “dead ReLU” issue\n",

    "### 6. **Softmax**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in **multi-class classification** (output layer)\n",
