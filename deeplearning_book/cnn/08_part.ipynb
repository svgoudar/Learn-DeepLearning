    "## CNN Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ **Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The input is an RGB image (3 color channels: Red, Green, Blue).\n",
    "* Example: Zebra image.\n",
    "* Size could be, say, 224×224×3.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ **Convolution + ReLU Layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Convolution Layer:** Applies filters (kernels) to detect features like edges, textures, shapes.\n",
    "* **ReLU Activation:** Adds non-linearity; replaces negative values with 0.\n",
    "* One convolution + ReLU = **one convolutional layer**.\n",
    "* In your example: 3 convolution layers stacked, each followed by pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ **Pooling Layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduce spatial dimensions (width × height) while keeping important features.\n",
    "* Example: Max pooling takes the maximum value in each window.\n",
    "* Helps in:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Reducing computation.\n",
    "  * Making features **location invariant**.\n",
    "* Sequence: Convolution + ReLU → Pooling → repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ **Feature Maps**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Output of each convolution layer after ReLU = **feature maps**.\n",
    "* They represent detected features (edges, patterns) of the image.\n",
    "* Stacking multiple layers extracts **higher-level features** progressively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ **Flattening Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Converts 2D feature maps into a **1D vector**.\n",
    "* Needed to feed data into a fully connected (dense) network.\n",
    "* Example: If feature maps are 8×8×32 → flatten → 2048-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6️⃣ **Fully Connected Layer (Dense Layer)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each neuron connects to all neurons in the previous layer.\n",
    "* Learns combinations of features to perform **classification**.\n",
    "* Example: Classifying an image as zebra, horse, or dog → 3 outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7️⃣ **Softmax Activation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Converts raw output scores into **probabilities**.\n",
    "* Ensures sum = 1.\n",
    "* Highest probability = predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8️⃣ **Forward & Backward Propagation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Forward Propagation:** Input → Conv+ReLU → Pooling → Flatten → Fully Connected → Output → Softmax.\n",
    "* **Backward Propagation:** Compute **loss** (difference between predicted and true labels) → update all **filter weights** in convolution layers using derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9️⃣ **Feature Extraction vs Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Extraction:** All convolution + pooling layers → extract patterns/features.\n",
    "* **Classification:** Fully connected + softmax → decide which class the image belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Covered**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature maps, feature extraction, convolution, ReLU, pooling, flattening, fully connected layers, softmax, forward/backward propagation.\n",
    "* RGB image handling is similar to grayscale but with **3 input channels** instead of 1.\n"
