    "### Grayscale Images\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** Images with only **one color channel**. Also called black-and-white images.\n",
    "* **Representation:** Height × Width × 1 (e.g., a 6×6 grayscale image is 6×6×1).\n",
    "* **Pixel values:** Each pixel has an intensity value ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).\n",
    "* **Example:** Classic black-and-white photos or early movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:** Since there’s only one channel, each pixel stores a single intensity value.\n",

    "### **2. RGB (Colored) Images**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** Images composed of **three color channels**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **R (Red)**\n",
    "  2. **G (Green)**\n",
    "  3. **B (Blue)**\n",
    "* **Representation:** Height × Width × 3 (e.g., a 4×4 RGB image is 4×4×3).\n",
    "* **Pixel values:** Each pixel in each channel ranges from 0 to 255.\n",
    "* **How it works:** Combining the three channels produces the full-color image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A colored photo of a parrot or landscape:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Red channel:** Highlights red intensity.\n",
    "* **Green channel:** Highlights green intensity.\n",
    "* **Blue channel:** Highlights blue intensity.\n",
    "* **Combination:** Full-color visualization.\n",

    "### **3. Pixels and Image Dimensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Images are made up of tiny units called **pixels**.\n",
    "* **Height × Width** = number of pixels.\n",
    "* **Channels** = depth of the image (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB).\n",
    "* **Notation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Grayscale → H×W×1\n",
    "  * RGB → H×W×3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 6×6 grayscale → 6×6×1\n",
    "* 4×4 RGB → 4×4×3\n",

    "### **4. Relevance for CNNs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* CNNs process images **numerically**.\n",
    "* Each pixel’s value acts as input data for the network.\n",
    "* Understanding **channels** is important because convolution operations are applied **per channel**, and features are extracted from either single-channel (grayscale) or multi-channel (RGB) images.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grayscale:** One channel, pixel values 0–255.\n",
    "2. **RGB:** Three channels (R, G, B), each pixel in each channel 0–255.\n",
    "3. Image shape: Height × Width × Channels.\n",
    "4. CNNs use these pixel values to **extract features** via convolution operations.\n",
