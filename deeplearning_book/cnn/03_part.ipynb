    "## Convolution Operation in CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "A CNN processes an image by applying **filters (kernels)** to extract useful features like edges, textures, and shapes. The **first step** in this process is the *convolution operation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Input Image Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Example image:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Size: **6 × 6 pixels**\n",
    "* Grayscale → only **1 channel**\n",
    "* So shape = **6 × 6 × 1**\n",
    "* Pixel values range from **0 (black)** to **255 (white)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example shown:\n",
    "Black (0) on one side, White (255) on the other → a clear **vertical edge** exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Step 1 — Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Before convolution, pixel values are **scaled to $$0,1$$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Normalized Pixel} = \\frac{\\text{Original Pixel}}{255}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0 → 0\n",
    "* 255 → 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the image is **6×6 with 0s and 1s**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Filters (Kernels) = Feature Detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A **filter** is a small matrix, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "3 × 3 filter  (example: vertical edge detector)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This filter slides over the image and extracts features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter example used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ 1   0  -1\n",
    "  2   0  -2\n",
    "  1   0  -1 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **vertical edge detection filter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Convolution Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Place the **3×3 filter** on a **3×3 patch** of the image.\n",
    "2. Multiply filter values with overlapping pixel values.\n",
    "3. Add all results → **one output value**\n",
    "4. Slide the filter and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sliding jump is called **stride**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here: **stride = 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example pixel calculation:\n",
    "Multiply each filter value with the corresponding image value → sum → one output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns the input **6×6** into **4×4** output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Output size} = (N - F) + 1 = (6 - 3) + 1 = 4\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So final output = **4 × 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Output Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "After convolution with this **vertical edge filter**, the output highlights **edges**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Higher values (or 255 after scaling) → white\n",
    "* Lower values (or 0 after scaling) → black\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "A **vertical line** appears in the output, showing where the black–white transition exists in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how CNNs **learn features automatically**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Why Stride and Padding Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "6×6 → 4×4 output = **loss of information**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "Add **padding** (extra border around the image) to preserve dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding is discussed next, but its purpose is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevent shrinking of output\n",
    "* Retain edge pixel information\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Filters = Feature Extraction Units\n",
    "\n",
    "Each filter detects **one type of pattern**, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vertical edges\n",
    "* Horizontal edges\n",
    "* Corners\n",
    "* Curves\n",
    "* Textures\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple filters → multiple feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real CNNs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filter values are **not manually set**\n",
    "* They are **randomly initialized**\n",
    "* Learned using **forward + backpropagation**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolution = Filter × Image Patch + Sliding**\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps CNNs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detect features (edges, textures, shapes)\n",
    "* Preserve spatial information\n",
    "* Reduce manual feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**First operation in CNN = Convolution**\n",
    "Next comes: **Padding**, then **Pooling**, then **Flattening → Fully Connected Layers**\n"
