    "## CNN (Convolution Neural Network)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition from ANN to CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "* Previously, we used **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** for structured data (numerical/categorical features).\n",
    "* ANN input: feature vector (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n).\n",
    "* CNN input: **images**, which are multi-dimensional arrays (height × width × channels).\n",
    "* CNNs are designed to **automatically extract spatial features** from images, unlike ANN where features must be manually defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases for CNNs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image classification (e.g., cat vs dog).\n",
    "2. Object detection (detecting objects and their locations).\n",
    "3. Image segmentation (classifying each pixel).\n",
    "4. Advanced tasks: facial recognition, autonomous driving, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Inspiration from the Human Brain\n",
    "\n",
    "* CNN architecture is inspired by **how the human visual system works**.\n",
    "* Two important brain regions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Cerebral cortex** – processes sensory input.\n",
    "  2. **Occipital lobe** – responsible for vision and image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy to CNN:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input image → “eye” sees it.\n",
    "* Signals pass through layers (like cerebral cortex → visual cortex layers V1 to V5).\n",
    "* Processed features → recognized by occipital lobe.\n",
    "* CNN layers mimic this hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Early layers → detect simple patterns (edges, corners).\n",
    "  * Deeper layers → detect complex patterns (shapes, objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Cortex Analogy (V1 to V5)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visual cortex processes visual information in stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **V1** → edges, orientations.\n",
    "  * **V2** → more complex shapes.\n",
    "  * **V3, V4** → textures, color patterns.\n",
    "  * **V5** → motion, high-level features.\n",
    "* CNN layers mimic this progression:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Convolution layers** → detect patterns like edges, textures.\n",
    "  * **Pooling layers** → reduce dimensionality while keeping important features.\n",
    "  * **Fully connected layers** → combine features to classify or recognize objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Human brain efficiently recognizes images by processing visual signals hierarchically.\n",
    "* CNNs replicate this process using mathematical layers.\n",
    "* This allows machines to perform tasks like humans: **recognize objects, detect movement, classify images**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CNNs handle **image inputs**.\n",
    "2. Inspired by **human visual system** (cerebral cortex → visual cortex → occipital lobe).\n",
    "3. Layers in CNNs progressively extract features, from simple to complex.\n",
    "4. Enables **image classification, detection, and segmentation**."
