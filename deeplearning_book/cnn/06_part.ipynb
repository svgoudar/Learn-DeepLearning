    "## Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Why pooling is used\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convolution + ReLU extracts features.\n",
    "* Pooling reduces spatial size and keeps only the most relevant information.\n",
    "* Helps with **location invariance**: small shifts or position changes in the feature still get detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Max Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filter slides over the feature map (commonly 2×2).\n",
    "* From each region, **pick the highest value**.\n",
    "* Stride is usually equal to filter size (e.g. 2).\n",
    "* Keeps the strongest activation → focuses on the most important features.\n",
    "* Example on a 2×2 block:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  1 2\n",
    "  4 3  →  max = 4\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output becomes smaller, e.g. from 4×4 to 2×2.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Min Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Same sliding window.\n",
    "* **Pick the smallest value** from each region.\n",
    "* Used rarely. Only when the weakest signals matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 2\n",
    "4 3  → min = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Average Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take **average** of values in each region.\n",
    "* Used when you want a smooth representation instead of strongest or weakest activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 2\n",
    "4 3  → avg = 2.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Location Invariance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose a filter detects a feature (e.g., cat face, wheel).\n",
    "* Even if the object shifts slightly in the image, max pooling captures the important activation.\n",
    "* Pooling ignores exact position and keeps **presence** of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Typical stack\n",
    "\n",
    "A CNN block often looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input → Convolution → ReLU → Pooling → (repeat) → Fully Connected Layer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You repeat convolution + pooling multiple times. At the end, flatten and pass to dense layers.\n",
    "\n",
