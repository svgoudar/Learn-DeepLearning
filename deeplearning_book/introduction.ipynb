    "## What is Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a **subset of Machine Learning (ML)**, which itself is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AI:** Machines doing tasks that require human intelligence (e.g., reasoning, planning, understanding language).\n",
    "* **ML:** Machines learning patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "* **DL:** Machines learning **complex patterns from large amounts of data** using structures called **Neural Networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a **hierarchy of learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ML can learn **simple patterns** (like linear relationships).\n",
    "* DL can learn **highly complex patterns**, like recognizing faces, understanding speech, or translating languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple diagram (concentric concept circles):\n",

    "![DL_01.png](images/DL_01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why “Deep\n",
    "\n",
    "The word **“deep”** in Deep Learning refers to the number of **layers** in the neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single layer → Shallow network (like simple ML models).\n",
    "* Multiple layers → Deep network (can capture complex features).\n",
    "\n",
    "These layers are called **hidden layers**, sandwiched between **input** and **output layers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Idea: Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of Deep Learning is the **Neural Network (NN)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inspired by the human brain.\n",
    "* Composed of **neurons** (small computation units).\n",
    "* Each neuron receives inputs, applies a function, and passes the result forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a neuron like a **decision gate**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take inputs (features from data).\n",
    "2. Assign weights to each input (importance).\n",
    "3. Sum them up and apply an activation function (decides if it “fires”).\n",

    "* **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Most popular, outputs max(0, x)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Propagation:**\n",
    "   Input → Layer by layer → Output prediction\n",
    "2. **Loss Calculation:**\n",
    "   Compare prediction with actual label using a **loss function** (like MSE for regression, Cross-Entropy for classification).\n",
    "3. **Backward Propagation:**\n",
    "   Compute gradients of loss w.r.t weights → update weights using **Gradient Descent**.\n",
